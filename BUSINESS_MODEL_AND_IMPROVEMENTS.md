## Revenue Model (What Judges Want to See)

### Phase 1: Free (Months 1-12) - BUILD TRUST
**Goal**: 50,000 active users
**Revenue**: $0
**Focus**: User acquisition, feedback, partnerships

**Why free?**
- Healthcare is sensitive - need trust first
- Competing with free alternatives (ChatGPT)
- Building network effects
- Collecting data for improvement

---

### Phase 2: Freemium (Months 13-24) - MONETIZE USERS

#### Free Tier (Always Free)
- Basic symptom analysis
- Emergency detection
- Hospital finder
- 10 chats per month

#### Premium Tier ($2/month or ₦3,000/month)
- Unlimited chats
- Priority response time
- Appointment booking
- Medical history tracking
- Family accounts (up to 5 people)
- SMS alerts for medication reminders

**Target**: 10% conversion rate
- 50,000 users × 10% = 5,000 premium users
- 5,000 × $2 = $10,000/month = $120,000/year

**Why $2/month?**
- Affordable for Nigerians (₦3,000)
- Less than 1 hospital visit
- Cheaper than data for multiple Google searches
- Comparable to Netflix/Spotify in Nigeria

---

### Phase 3: B2B Partnerships (Months 25-36) - SCALE REVENUE

#### Revenue Stream 1: Hospital Referrals
**Model**: Hospitals pay ₦500 per patient referred
- We send 1,000 patients/month to partner hospitals
- 1,000 × ₦500 = ₦500,000/month = $600/month
- Scale to 10 hospitals = $6,000/month

**Why hospitals pay?**
- They get qualified patients (pre-screened by AI)
- Reduces emergency room crowding
- Improves patient outcomes
- Marketing cost is higher than ₦500/patient

#### Revenue Stream 2: Insurance Partnerships
**Model**: Insurance companies pay for preventive care
- Partner with HMOs (Hygeia, Avon, Reliance)
- They pay ₦200/user/month for their members
- 10,000 insured users × ₦200 = ₦2M/month = $2,400/month

**Why insurance pays?**
- Preventive care reduces claims
- Early detection saves money
- Healthier members = lower costs
- We provide data on health trends

#### Revenue Stream 3: Government Contracts
**Model**: State governments pay for rural coverage
- ₦50M/year per state contract
- Target 3 states in Year 3 = ₦150M = $180,000/year

**Why government pays?**
- Addresses UN SDG 3 (Good Health)
- Reduces healthcare burden
- Reaches rural areas cheaply
- Political win (healthcare access)

#### Revenue Stream 4: Pharmaceutical Partnerships
**Model**: Pharma companies sponsor health education
- ₦5M/month for branded health tips
- Non-intrusive (educational content only)
- = $6,000/month = $72,000/year

**Why pharma pays?**
- Access to health-conscious audience
- Brand awareness
- Educational marketing (not ads)
- Compliance-friendly

## Unit Economics (Show You Understand Business)

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Social media ads: $0.50/user
- Hospital partnerships: $0.20/user
- Word of mouth: $0/user
- **Average CAC**: $0.30/user

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Free user: $0 direct, $2 indirect (referrals, data)
- Premium user: $24/year × 3 years = $72
- **Average LTV**: $5/user (assuming 10% premium conversion)

### LTV/CAC Ratio
- $5 / $0.30 = 16.7x
- **Healthy ratio** (>3x is good, >10x is excellent)

### Break-Even Point
- Need 2,500 premium users to cover $5,000/month costs
- At 10% conversion: need 25,000 total users
- **Achievable in 6 months**

## Questions Judges Will Ask About Money

### Q: "How will you make money?"
**A**: "Three-phase approach: Free to build trust, Freemium to monetize users, B2B to scale revenue. We'll be profitable in Year 2 with just 5,000 premium users at $2/month."

### Q: "Why would anyone pay when it's free?"
**A**: "Free tier is limited to 10 chats/month. Premium adds unlimited chats, appointment booking, medical history, and family accounts. It's $2/month - less than one hospital visit."

### Q: "What if people just use ChatGPT for free?"
**A**: "ChatGPT doesn't speak Pidgin, doesn't know Nigerian hospitals, doesn't detect emergencies, and isn't medical-specific. We're not competing on price - we're competing on relevance."

### Q: "How much will this cost to run?"
**A**: "Year 1: $5k (API + hosting). Year 2: $50k (small team). Year 3: $500k (team of 10). Gemini API is cheap - $0.00025 per request. At 100k users, that's only $500/month."

### Q: "When will you break even?"
**A**: "We need 2,500 premium users to cover $5k/month costs. At 10% conversion, that's 25,000 total users. We can reach that in 6 months with hospital partnerships and social media."

### Q: "What's your exit strategy?"
**A**: "Three options:
1. Acquisition by Helium Health or similar (2-3 years)
2. Series A funding to expand to other African countries (3-4 years)
3. Sustainable business generating $1M+/year (5 years)"
