## 🎬 Demo Script

### Opening (15 seconds)
"In rural Nigeria, 60% of people live more than 5km from hospitals. When emergencies happen at night, they don't know what to do."

### Problem (30 seconds)
"Language barriers, distance, and lack of information create life-threatening delays. Existing solutions don't work offline or speak Pidgin."

### Demo (90 seconds)
1. **Show emergency detection:**
   - Type "severe bleeding"
   - Show 🚨 EMERGENCY indicator
   - Show "Call 112" + hospitals appear
   - Show location request

2. **Show Pidgin support:**
   - Type "My body dey hot"
   - AI responds in Pidgin
   - Show 🟡 MEDIUM urgency

3. **Show offline mode:**
   - Turn off network
   - Type emergency
   - Still get guidance + hospital contacts

4. **Show PWA:**
   - Install prompt appears
   - "Works like WhatsApp"
   - Offline page with emergency contacts

### Innovation (30 seconds)
"We use WHO guidelines, safety filters, urgency triage, and work completely offline. The app is installable and costs $0.001 per consultation."

### Impact (15 seconds)
"Can reach 75 million Pidgin speakers. Every second counts in emergencies. HealthAI provides instant guidance when hospitals are far away."
