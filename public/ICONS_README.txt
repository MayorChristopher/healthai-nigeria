PWA ICONS NEEDED:

Create two PNG icons with green medical cross or health symbol:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

Design:
- Background: Green (#16a34a)
- Icon: White medical cross or lightbulb symbol
- Simple, recognizable design

Quick generation options:
1. Use Canva.com (free)
2. Use Figma (free)
3. Use any image editor

Place both files in the /public folder.

For now, the app will work without icons, but they improve the install experience.
