# HealthAI Nigeria - Demo Script 🎤

**Time Limit:** 3-5 minutes  
**Target:** Hackathon judges and audience

## 🎯 Opening (30 seconds)

**[Stand confidently, make eye contact]**

"Good morning/afternoon! My name is Mayor Ugochukwu, and I'm here to present **HealthAI Nigeria**.

In rural Nigeria, over **60% of people live more than 5 kilometers from the nearest hospital**. When medical emergencies happen at night—chest pain, severe bleeding, difficulty breathing—families don't know what to do. They can't reach a doctor. They don't know if it's serious. And by the time they travel to a hospital, it might be too late.

**HealthAI solves this problem.**"

## 📋 Backup Talking Points

### If Internet Fails:
"Let me show you screenshots of the live demo..." 
[Have screenshots ready in practice/screenshots/]

### If Asked About Accuracy:
"The AI is powered by Google Gemini and trained on medical knowledge. However, we clearly state it's NOT a replacement for professional care—it's a triage tool to help people make informed decisions."

### If Asked About Monetization:
"Currently free for social impact. Future revenue could come from hospital partnerships, premium features for clinics, or government healthcare contracts."

### If Asked About Data Privacy:
"We don't store any conversations or personal health data. Everything is session-based and deleted when the browser closes. Privacy is a core principle."

### If Asked About Misuse:
"We have clear disclaimers, emergency warnings, and always recommend calling 112 for critical cases. The AI is designed to guide, not diagnose."
