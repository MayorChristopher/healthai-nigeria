THE PROBLEM

In rural Nigeria, over 60% of people live more than 5 kilometers from the nearest hospital. When medical emergencies happen at night—chest pain, severe bleeding, difficulty breathing—families don't know what to do. They can't reach a doctor. They don't know if it's serious. And by the time they travel to a hospital, it might be too late.

Language barriers make things worse. Many rural Nigerians speak Pidgin, not English. Existing health apps don't understand them. Distance, language, and lack of information create life-threatening delays in getting proper medical attention.

================================================================================

OUR SOLUTION

HealthAI provides instant medical guidance 24/7, right when people need it most. Our AI-powered assistant analyzes symptoms in both English and Nigerian Pidgin, detects emergencies automatically, and connects users to nearby hospitals with one-click calling and directions.

No registration required. Completely free. Works on any device, even with slow internet.

Key Features:
- Emergency detection using Google Gemini AI
- Multilingual support (English and Nigerian Pidgin)
- Hospital finder with 6 major Nigerian teaching hospitals
- One-click calling and Google Maps directions
- Privacy-first design (no data storage)
- Mobile-responsive interface

================================================================================

HOW IT WORKS

1. User describes symptoms in English or Pidgin
2. AI analyzes and detects if it's an emergency
3. System provides immediate guidance and shows nearest hospitals
4. User can call hospital or get directions instantly

The entire process takes less than 30 seconds. For emergencies, every second counts.

TECHNOLOGY STACK

- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- AI: Google Gemini API for natural language processing
- Deployment: Vercel for global accessibility
- Design: Mobile-first, works on slow connections

IMPACT & UN SDG ALIGNMENT

This project directly addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being.

Expected Impact:
- Reduced emergency response time in rural areas
- Increased healthcare access for 60%+ of rural Nigerians
- Improved health literacy through instant guidance
- Lives saved through early emergency detection

Target Reach:
- Phase 1: 3 states (Enugu, Lagos, Kaduna)
- Phase 2: All 36 Nigerian states
- Phase 3: Other African countries

================================================================================

WHY THIS MATTERS

Nigeria has 200+ million people, many in underserved rural areas. Mobile phone penetration is over 80%, but healthcare access remains limited. HealthAI bridges this gap by bringing medical guidance to people's phones, wherever they are.

We're not replacing doctors. We're providing the first line of guidance when hospitals are far away and emergencies can't wait.

================================================================================

- Free - No payment or subscription required
- Accessible - Works in Nigerian Pidgin
