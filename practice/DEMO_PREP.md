# Demo Preparation - HealthAI Nigeria

## 🎯 **5-Minute Demo Script**

### **Opening (30s)**
"We built HealthAI - AI medical assistant for Nigeria. 60% of rural Nigerians live 5km+ from hospitals. HealthAI provides 24/7 guidance in English and Pidgin."

### **Live Demo (3min)**
1. **Normal**: "I have headache" → Show AI response + disclaimers
2. **Emergency**: "Chest pain" → Show red alert + hospitals + call buttons
3. **Pidgin**: "My belle dey pain me" → Show Pidgin response
4. **Mobile**: Open on phone → Show responsive design

### **Tech Highlights (90s)**
"Advanced safety filtering, emergency fallbacks, 20+ hospitals, cultural intelligence, production-quality design."

### **Closing (30s)**
"Working prototype built in 48 hours. Needs medical validation for production. Seeking partnerships."

## 🤔 **Judge Questions & Answers**

**"Is this medically safe?"**
→ "Prototype with safety filters. Production needs medical validation, which we're seeking."

**"What makes this different from ChatGPT?"**
→ "Three things: Nigerian Pidgin support, emergency detection with local hospitals, and cultural context for health."

**"Can it scale to 1M users?"**
→ "Current: hundreds of users. Million-scale needs $50K investment for paid APIs and infrastructure."

**"What if AI gives wrong advice?"**
→ "Multiple safety layers: response filtering, disclaimers, emergency detection, terms acceptance."

**"How do you make money?"**
→ "Hospital partnerships, freemium model, or open source. Proving value first."

**"Why not just use Google?"**
→ "Google doesn't understand Pidgin, doesn't know Nigerian hospitals, doesn't auto-detect emergencies."
