## 🎤 Team Elevator Pitch

*"We're HealthBridge Nigeria—three Nigerian developers on a mission to save lives. We built HealthAI because 60% of rural Nigerians live over 5km from the nearest hospital. When emergencies happen at night, they have nowhere to turn. Our AI-powered assistant provides instant medical guidance in English and Pidgin, detects emergencies, and connects people to nearby hospitals—all for free, 24/7. We're not just building an app; we're building a lifeline for millions."*
