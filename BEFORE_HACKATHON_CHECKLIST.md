# Before Hackathon - Final Checklist

## 🎯 MUST DO (Critical)

### 1. Test That It Actually Works
- [ ] Get Gemini API key from https://ai.google.dev/
- [ ] Add to `.env.local` file
- [ ] Run `npm install`
- [ ] Run `npm run dev`
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Test a normal symptom (e.g., "I have a headache")
- [ ] Test an emergency (e.g., "I have chest pain")
- [ ] Test Pidgin (e.g., "My belle dey pain me")
- [ ] Verify all 3 scenarios work

**If any test fails, FIX IT before the hackathon.**

### 2. Prepare Your Demo
- [ ] Practice the demo 5 times
- [ ] Time it (should be under 2 minutes)
- [ ] Have backup screenshots in case internet fails
- [ ] Know exactly what you'll type in the chat
- [ ] Test on your phone (mobile demo is impressive)

### 3. Know Your Answers
- [ ] Read `REALITY.md` completely
- [ ] Read `HONEST_PITCH.md` Q&A section
- [ ] Practice answering: "Is this medically validated?" (Answer: No, it's a prototype)
- [ ] Practice answering: "How will you make money?" (Answer: Haven't decided, focused on proving value first)
- [ ] Practice answering: "What's your biggest challenge?" (Answer: Medical validation and hospital partnerships)

### 4. Deploy (Optional but Impressive)
- [ ] Push code to GitHub
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Test production URL
- [ ] Have URL ready to show judges

## 📊 NICE TO HAVE (If Time)

### Polish
- [ ] Take screenshots of all 3 demo scenarios
- [ ] Create a simple slide deck (use `HONEST_PITCH.md`)
- [ ] Print QR code to your deployed site
- [ ] Prepare 1-page handout with key points

### Backup Plans
- [ ] Download video recording of working demo
- [ ] Have screenshots ready
- [ ] Test on mobile hotspot (in case WiFi fails)
- [ ] Charge your laptop fully

## 🗣️ WHAT TO SAY

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm Mayor. We built HealthAI - an AI health assistant for Nigerian communities. 60% of rural Nigerians live far from hospitals. When symptoms appear at night, families don't know if it's serious. Let me show you what we built."

### Demo (60 seconds)
[Show the 3 scenarios - normal, emergency, Pidgin]

### Honesty (30 seconds)
"This is a 48-hour prototype. It's not medically validated. The hospital list is hardcoded. But it proves the concept works. We need medical advisors and hospital partners to make it real."

### Close (15 seconds)
"We learned a ton building this. We're honest about limitations. We're coachable. Give us mentorship and we'll build it right. Questions?"

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO SAY

- ❌ "We have hospital partnerships" (you don't)
- ❌ "Ready to scale to millions" (you're not)
- ❌ "Profitable in Year 2" (no revenue model)
- ❌ "This will save lives" (too bold for a prototype)

## ✅ WHAT TO SAY INSTEAD

- ✅ "This is a working prototype"
- ✅ "We need validation before scaling"
- ✅ "We're exploring revenue models"
- ✅ "This could help people if built properly"

## 🎤 JUDGE QUESTIONS - QUICK ANSWERS

**Q: Is this safe to use?**
A: "Not yet. It's a demo. We'd need medical validation before any real deployment."

**Q: What's your competitive advantage?**
A: "Pidgin support and focus on Nigerian context. But honestly, execution matters more than the idea."

**Q: How much funding do you need?**
A: "If we pursue this, probably $50K for a 12-month runway to build it properly with medical advisors."

**Q: What did you learn?**
A: "How to integrate AI, design for healthcare, and the massive gap between prototype and production. We learned what we don't know."

**Q: Why should we pick you?**
A: "We built a working demo in 48 hours. We're honest about limitations. We're hungry to learn. We'll execute if given the chance."

## 📱 DAY OF HACKATHON
