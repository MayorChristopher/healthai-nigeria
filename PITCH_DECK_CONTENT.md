## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
```
Healthcare is Out of Reach for Millions

60% of rural Nigerians live 5km+ from hospitals

When emergencies happen at night:
• Families don't know if symptoms are serious
• Language barriers (80M Pidgin speakers)
• No 24/7 medical guidance
• Delays cost lives

Market: 200M Nigerians, 80% with phones, $5B healthcare market
```
